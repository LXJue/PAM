Description: ‘Performs the Penalized Adaptive Method (PAM), a combination of propagation-separation approach and a SCAD penalty, to fit a model with possible structural changes on a given dataset. The model is then used for forecasting over a 1-year horizon. The input data are monthly observations of k-year excess bond risk premia, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, forward rates and other pre-defined macro variables. Computes RMSPE and MAPE for the forecasted values. Plots the time series of the predicted vs. observed values of bond risk excess premia over the prediction interval.’

Keywords: ‘linear model, regression, SCAD penalty, bic, time varying, change point, bootstrap, plot, visualization, nonstationary, financial, prediction’
